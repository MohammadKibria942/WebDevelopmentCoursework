            <h1>History of Football</h1>
            <p>Football began in England over 100 years ago in 1863, when football and rugby split ways. this was also when the Football association,<br>
                formerly known as the FA was created. 8 years after the creation fo the FA, they had established 50 member clubs, thats when in 1972 the FA cup<br>
                 was created, with the first championship in the works by 1888.
